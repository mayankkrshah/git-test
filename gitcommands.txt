1> Download Git

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

2> Download Github Gui

https://desktop.github.com/

3> Signup on Github

4> Create new repository

5> Copy link of remote repository which will be available once we create 
repository.

- to link local code base to remote one.

6> Setup username and email using the commands

git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@provider.com"

7> Check all git configurations using the command 
git config --list

8> Initializing Git Repository

- make a sample folder git-test
- It is a local repository and we need to make a remote repository
- run the command git init

9> Git will create hidden .git directory in the current folder. This folder
will contain object files which will be used by Git to store important 
information about the repository and keep track of changed files. Unless a folder
has a .git repository inside it, Git wont treat it as a repository.

10> Link local repository with remote repository using the command
git remote add origin repo-url


11> If we already have remote repository we can get the files using the command
git clone repo-url [folder]

folder is an optional path to the local folder which will be local repository.
If folder name is not given git will create new folder with the name same as 
remote repository name. This will initialize .git directory inside it and set
origin to repo-url. It will also pull code from remote repository into the 
local repository.

12> Check if local repository is tracking the remote repository using 
git remote -v command 


13> Replace remote url using the command 
git remote set-url origin repo-url

14> Commits
We commit only the changed files.
A commit logs a change or series of changed you have made to a file.
A series of commit is a git history. 
  
A commit object contains file change metadata, the name of the author of the 
commit, a timestamp of when commit was made, previous commit's hash. Based on 
this information hash of new commit is generated.
If any information inside a commit changes, hash will also change.

Whenever we use git push or git pull we are fetching or sending these commits 
to remote repository. Git on remote repository server then merges these commits
to its local repository.

Local repository has 3 different virtual zones or areas. working area, staging area and 
commit area. Working area is where you create new files, delete old files or 
make changes to already existing files. Staging area is also called the 'Index'.

Whenever we create a commit, Git will take changed code from staging area
and make a commit which it moves to commit area. Unless we use git push command,
these commits wont be sent to remote repository.

15> Checking the current status of a file
git status

16> Add a single file into staging area
git add add.js

17> Add all files including newly added, deleted and changed files.
git add -A stages all changes
git add . stages new files and modifications, without deletions
git add -u stages modifications and deletions, without new files


18> To unstage a file added by mistake in the staging area we can use the command
git reset add.js

19> Use git reset to unstage all files.
git reset

20> Commit the changes 
git commit -m "initial commit"
-m flag is used to insert a message that will describe the commit.

On commit the file using git commit -m "message" files will be committed
and it will show 
create mode 100644 divide.js

// Note: create mode indicates new file is added.


21> To see all commits in the repository made by all the developers use the command
git log

git log will show the commit hash, the author and the commit message along with
other details.

22> To see file that was changed or added in a commit, use stat argument with 
git log  like git log --stat.

got log --stat

23> To change message of previous commit 
git commend --amend -m "Initial Commit"
It will also change hash of the commit
